Overall Status: Research/ Proposal Submitted 

Number of hours worked since last update: 15 hours
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 65 hours
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 70 hours

Accomplishments: Got firebase hosting up and working. Explore page is working, just not good looking. Created individual recipe page to view ingredients and instructions.
Website viewable at https://meal-plan-generator-745c7.firebaseapp.com/ though very roughcut.


Challenges: Being able to edit the recipe, not importing the recipe correctly.


Plans / Goals for next week: Get the edit form working correctly. Improve the recipe form to be more user friendly. Get the generator working. SRS document done.


Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
Tell my wife what I need to get done, and she will remind me if I don't get them done.
